# Build a Game-playing Agent

![Example game of isolation](viz.gif)

## Synopsis

In this project, students will develop an adversarial search agent to play the game "Isolation".  Isolation is a deterministic, two-player game of perfect information in which the players alternate turns moving a single piece from one cell to another on a board.  Whenever either player occupies a cell, that cell becomes blocked for the remainder of the game.  The first player with no remaining legal moves loses, and the opponent is declared the winner.  These rules are implemented in the `isolation.Board` class provided in the repository. 

This project uses a version of Isolation where each agent is restricted to L-shaped movements (like a knight in chess) on a rectangular grid (like a chess or checkerboard).  The agents can move to any open cell on the board that is 2-rows and 1-column or 2-columns and 1-row away from their current position on the board. Movements are blocked at the edges of the board (the board does not wrap around), however, the player can "jump" blocked or occupied spaces (just like a knight in chess).

Additionally, agents will have a fixed time limit each turn to search for the best move and respond.  If the time limit expires during a player's turn, that player forfeits the match, and the opponent wins.

Students only need to modify code in the `game_agent.py` file to complete the project.  Additional files include example Player and evaluation functions, the game board class, and a template to develop local unit tests.  


### Quickstart Guide

The following example creates a game and illustrates the basic API.  You can run this example by activating your aind anaconda environment and executing the command `python sample_players.py`

    from isolation import Board

    # create an isolation board (by default 7x7)
    player1 = RandomPlayer()
    player2 = GreedyPlayer()
    game = Board(player1, player2)

    # place player 1 on the board at row 2, column 3, then place player 2 on
    # the board at row 0, column 5; display the resulting board state.  Note
    # that the .apply_move() method changes the calling object in-place.
    game.apply_move((2, 3))
    game.apply_move((0, 5))
    print(game.to_string())

    # players take turns moving on the board, so player1 should be next to move
    assert(player1 == game.active_player)

    # get a list of the legal moves available to the active player
    print(game.get_legal_moves())

    # get a successor of the current state by making a copy of the board and
    # applying a move. Notice that this does NOT change the calling object
    # (unlike .apply_move()).
    new_game = game.forecast_move((1, 1))
    assert(new_game.to_string() != game.to_string())
    print("\nOld state:\n{}".format(game.to_string()))
    print("\nNew state:\n{}".format(new_game.to_string()))

    # play the remainder of the game automatically -- outcome can be "illegal
    # move", "timeout", or "forfeit"
    winner, history, outcome = game.play()
    print("\nWinner: {}\nOutcome: {}".format(winner, outcome))
    print(game.to_string())
    print("Move history:\n{!s}".format(history))





### Tournament

The `tournament.py` script is used to evaluate the effectiveness of  custom heuristics.  The script measures relative performance of my agent (named "Student" in the tournament) in a round-robin tournament against several other pre-defined agents.  The Student agent uses time-limited Iterative Deepening along with your custom heuristics.

The performance of time-limited iterative deepening search is hardware dependent (faster hardware is expected to search deeper than slower hardware in the same amount of time).  The script controls for these effects by also measuring the baseline performance of an agent called "ID_Improved" that uses Iterative Deepening and the improved_score heuristic defined in `sample_players.py`.  Your goal is to develop a heuristic such that Student outperforms ID_Improved. (NOTE: This can be _very_ challenging!)

The tournament opponents are listed below. (See also: sample heuristics and players defined in sample_players.py)

- Random: An agent that randomly chooses a move each turn.
- MM_Open: MinimaxPlayer agent using the open_move_score heuristic with search depth 3
- MM_Center: MinimaxPlayer agent using the center_score heuristic with search depth 3
- MM_Improved: MinimaxPlayer agent using the improved_score heuristic with search depth 3
- AB_Open: AlphaBetaPlayer using iterative deepening alpha-beta search and the open_move_score heuristic
- AB_Center: AlphaBetaPlayer using iterative deepening alpha-beta search and the center_score heuristic
- AB_Improved: AlphaBetaPlayer using iterative deepening alpha-beta search and the improved_score heuristic
